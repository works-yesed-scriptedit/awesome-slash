## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Doc/Code Ratio Detection** - New `doc_code_ratio_js` pattern flags JSDoc blocks that are disproportionately longer than the functions they document (threshold: 3x function length)
  - Uses multi-pass analysis to compute actual doc/code ratio
  - Skips tiny functions (< 3 lines) to avoid false positives
  - Severity `medium`, autoFix `flag` (requires manual review)
  - New `lib/patterns/slop-analyzers.js` module for structural code analysis
- **Issue/PR Reference Cleanup** - New `issue_pr_references` pattern flags ANY mention of issue/PR/iteration numbers in code comments as slop (e.g., `#123`, `PR #456`, `iteration 5`)
  - Context belongs in commits and PRs, not code comments
  - Severity `medium`, autoFix `remove` (clear slop)
  - Excludes markdown files where issue references are appropriate
- **File Path Reference Detection** - New `file_path_references` pattern flags file path references in comments that may become outdated (e.g., `// see auth-flow.md`)
  - Severity `low`, autoFix `flag` (may have valid documentation purpose)
- **Multi-Pass Pattern Helper** - New `getMultiPassPatterns()` function to retrieve patterns requiring structural analysis
- **Placeholder Function Detection** - New patterns for `/deslop-around` command (#98)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: stub returns (0, true, false, null, [], {}), empty functions, throw Error("TODO")
  - Rust: todo!(), unimplemented!(), panic!("TODO")
  - Python: raise NotImplementedError, pass-only functions, ellipsis bodies
  - Go: panic("TODO") placeholders
  - Java: throw UnsupportedOperationException()
  - All patterns have severity `high` and autoFix `flag` (requires manual review)
  - Test files are excluded to prevent false positives

### Fixed
- **Reality Check Output Size** - Condensed collector output to ~700 lines/~4.5k tokens (was thousands of lines)
  - Issue/PR bodies replaced with 200-char snippets (full context not needed)
  - Categorized issues store number + title (enough to understand without lookup)
  - PRs include files changed for scope understanding
  - Documentation features limited to 20, plans to 15
  - Code structure replaced with summary stats + top-level dirs only
  - File stats limited to top 10 extensions
  - **Added symbol extraction** - function/class/export names per source file (up to 40 files)
    - Helps agent verify if documented features are actually implemented
    - Scans lib/, src/, app/, pages/, components/, utils/, services/, api/ dirs
