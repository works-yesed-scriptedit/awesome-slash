## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- Published to npm as `awesome-slash` for easier installation
- Added `.npmignore` and `files` field for optimized package size (191KB → 143KB)

### Changed
- npm is now the recommended installation method
- Updated README with npm badges and installation instructions

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Reality Check Plugin**: Deep repository analysis to detect plan drift and gaps
  - Multi-agent parallel scanning architecture (issue-scanner, doc-analyzer, code-explorer, plan-synthesizer)
  - Detects drift: plan stagnation, priority neglect, documentation lag, scope overcommit
  - Identifies gaps: missing tests, outdated docs, overdue milestones
  - Cross-references documented vs implemented features
  - Generates prioritized reconstruction plans (immediate, short-term, medium-term, backlog)
  - Interactive first-run setup with checkbox configuration
  - Configurable via `.claude/reality-check.local.md` settings file
  - Commands: `/reality-check:scan`, `/reality-check:set`
  - Includes `reality-analysis` skill for drift detection patterns and prioritization frameworks

### Improved
- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced `workflow-state.test.js` to verify state immutability after failed operations (#60)
  - Added validation that `startPhase()` with invalid phase name leaves state completely unchanged
  - Ensures no partial writes occur when operations fail
  - Strengthens guarantee of atomic state updates


## [2.3.1] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Error Handling**: `readState()` now returns Error object for corrupted JSON files instead of null (#50)
  - Enables distinction between missing files (returns `null`) and corrupted files (returns `Error` with code `ERR_STATE_CORRUPTED`)
  - Updated all internal callers and plugin copies to handle Error returns gracefully
- **Security**: `deepMerge()` prototype pollution protection now applied to all plugin copies
  - Prevents `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` key injection attacks
  - Uses `Object.keys()` instead of `for...in` to avoid inherited property iteration
  - Handles null/undefined and Date objects properly
- **Ship CI Loop**: Mandatory comment resolution before merge
  - Phase 4 now ALWAYS runs, even when called from /next-task
  - Phase 6 includes mandatory pre-merge check for zero unresolved threads
  - Clarified that "SKIPS review" only applies to Phase 5 internal agents, not external auto-reviewers

## [2.3.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **CI & Review Monitor Loop** for `/ship` command (#79)
  - Continuous monitoring loop waits for CI AND addresses ALL PR feedback
  - Auto-waits 3 minutes on first iteration for review bots (Gemini, CodeRabbit)
  - Configurable via `SHIP_INITIAL_WAIT` environment variable
  - Addresses every comment: fixes, answers questions, or explains resolution
  - GraphQL-based thread resolution and reply functionality
- **Comprehensive Command Injection Tests**: 44 new test cases for `verify-tools.js` (#61, #78)
  - Newline injection patterns (LF, CR, CRLF)
  - Null byte injection
  - Path traversal (Unix and Windows)
  - Command substitution (backticks, dollar-paren)
  - Quote escaping (single and double quotes)
  - Shell metacharacters (pipes, redirects, operators, globs)

### Changed
- **Progressive Disclosure Refactoring** for reduced context consumption
  - `ship.md`: 1697 → 337 lines (-80%), split into 4 files
  - `project-review.md`: 929 → 273 lines (-71%), split into 3 files
  - All core command files now under 500 line limit per Claude Code best practices
  - Reference files loaded on-demand, reducing base context consumption
- **Explicit Workflow State Updates** in next-task agents
  - Mandatory state updates box diagrams in all agents
  - Clear `recordStepCompletion()` function template
  - Explicit /ship invocation requirement after docs-updater
  - Worktree cleanup responsibilities matrix
  - "Existing session" vs "stale session" semantics clarified

### Fixed
- **Security**: Protected `deepMerge` against prototype pollution attacks
- **Security**: Improved input validation in core libraries
- **Performance**: Optimized core library operations

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Version Sync** - All package manifests now correctly report version 2.2.1
  - `plugin.json` was stuck at 2.1.2
  - `package-lock.json` was stuck at 1.2.0

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Two-File State Management** to prevent workflow collisions
  - `tasks.json` in main repo: Shared registry of claimed tasks
  - `workflow-status.json` in worktree: Local step tracking with timestamps
  - Resume by task ID, branch name, or worktree path
- **New Agents**
  - `ci-fixer.md` (sonnet): Fix CI failures and PR comments, called by ci-monitor
  - `simple-fixer.md` (haiku): Execute pre-defined code fixes mechanically
- **Workflow Enforcement Gates** - Explicit STOP gates in all agents
  - Agents cannot skip review-orchestrator, delivery-validator, docs-updater
  - Agents cannot create PRs - only /ship creates PRs
  - SubagentStop hooks enforce mandatory workflow sequence
- **State Schema Files**
  - `tasks-registry.schema.json`: Schema for main repo task registry
  - `worktree-status.schema.json`: Schema for worktree step tracking

### Changed
- **Model Optimization** for cost efficiency
  - `policy-selector`: sonnet → haiku (simple checkbox UI)
  - `worktree-manager`: sonnet → haiku (scripted git commands)
  - `task-discoverer`: sonnet → inherit (varies by context)
  - `ci-monitor`: sonnet → haiku (watching) + sonnet subagent (fixing)
  - `deslop-work`: Now delegates fixes to simple-fixer (haiku)
  - `docs-updater`: Now delegates fixes to simple-fixer (haiku)
- **test-coverage-checker** enhanced with quality validation
  - Validates tests actually exercise new code (not just path matching)
  - Detects trivial assertions (e.g., `expect(true).toBe(true)`)
  - Checks for edge case coverage
  - Verifies tests import the source file they claim to test
- **next-task.md** refactored from 761 to ~350 lines
  - Progressive disclosure - orchestrates agents, doesn't duplicate knowledge
  - Ends at delivery validation, hands off to /ship
  - Added State Management Architecture section
- **ship.md** integration with next-task
  - Skips review loop when called from next-task (already done)
  - Removes task from registry on cleanup

### Fixed
- Workflow enforcement: Agents can no longer skip mandatory gates
- State collisions: Parallel workflows no longer write to same file
- Trigger language standardized: "Use this agent [when/after] X to Y"
- Removed "CRITICAL" language from worktree-manager (per best practices)
- Added model choice rationale documentation to all agents

## [2.1.2] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Codex CLI Install Script**: Now uses `codex mcp add` command for proper MCP server registration
- **Codex Skills**: Creates skills in proper `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` folder structure per Codex docs
- **OpenCode Install Script**: Uses `opencode.json` config with proper `mcp` object format
- **OpenCode Agents**: Creates agents with proper markdown frontmatter (description, mode, tools)

- **Workflow Automation** - No human intervention from plan approval until policy stop point

### Changed
