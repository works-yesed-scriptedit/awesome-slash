# Project Memory: awesome-slash

This file contains critical instructions for AI assistants working in this repository.

See @README.md for project overview and @CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.

## Release Process

All releases include **both npm publish and GitHub tag**:

```bash
npm version patch && git push origin main --tags && npm publish
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "See CHANGELOG.md"
```

---

## PR Auto-Review Process

> **CRITICAL**: Every PR receives automatic reviews from **4 agents**:
> - **Copilot** - GitHub's AI reviewer
> - **Claude** - Anthropic's AI reviewer
> - **Gemini** - Google's AI reviewer
> - **Codex** - OpenAI's AI reviewer

**Mandatory workflow:**
1. After PR creation, wait **at least 3 minutes** for first review round
2. Read **ALL comments** from all 4 reviewers
3. Address **EVERY comment** - no exceptions
4. Iterate until **zero unresolved threads** (typically 2-4 rounds)

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS address all comments, including "minor" or "nit" suggestions
- NEVER skip a comment unless factually wrong or user-approved
- Treat all feedback as **required changes**, not suggestions

| 3 | `worktree-manager` | haiku | Bash(git:*) | Create isolated worktree |
| 4 | `exploration-agent` | opus | Read, Grep, Glob, LSP, Task | Deep codebase analysis |
| 5 | `planning-agent` | opus | Read, Grep, EnterPlanMode, Task | Design implementation plan |
| 6 | **USER APPROVAL** | - | - | Last human touchpoint |
| 7 | `implementation-agent` | opus | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Execute plan |

### MUST-CALL Agents (Cannot Skip)

- **`exploration-agent`** - Required for understanding codebase before planning
- **`planning-agent`** - Required for creating implementation plan
- **`review-orchestrator`** - Required for code review before shipping
- **`delivery-validator`** - Required before calling /ship

### /ship - PR Workflow

The ship command **MUST execute these phases**:

| Phase | Responsibility | Required Tools |

| 4 | **CI & Review Monitor Loop** | Bash(gh:*), Task(ci-fixer) |
| 5 | Internal review (standalone only) | Task(*-reviewer) |
| 6 | Merge PR | Bash(gh:*) |
| 7-10 | Deploy & validate | Bash(deployment:*) |

> **Phase 4 is MANDATORY** - even when called from /next-task.
> External auto-reviewers (Copilot, Claude, Gemini, Codex) comment AFTER PR creation.
