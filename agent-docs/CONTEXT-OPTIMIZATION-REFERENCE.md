## 1. Token Budgeting Strategies

### The TALE Framework

Research from 2024-2025 shows that reasoning processes in LLMs are often unnecessarily lengthy. The TALE (Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning) framework demonstrates:

- **67% reduction** in output token costs
- **59% reduction** in expenses
- **Competitive accuracy** maintained vs vanilla Chain-of-Thought

**Key finding**: Including a reasonable token budget (e.g., 50 tokens) in instructions can reduce CoT token costs from 258 to 86 tokens while maintaining correct answers.

### Budget Allocation by Task Type

| Task Type | Token Budget | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Classification/Retrieval | 50-200 tokens | Minimal context needed |
| Creative Generation | 500-1,500 tokens | Richer context for quality |
| Multi-turn Reasoning | 2,000+ tokens | Extended analysis required |
| Code Generation | 1,000-4,000 tokens | Balance detail with constraints |
| Legal/Financial Analysis | 4,000+ tokens | Complex multi-document reasoning |

### ROI-Weighted Token Allocation

Not all tokens add equal value:

```text
High-value tokens (preserve):
- Customer identifiers
- Specific technical requirements
- Error messages and stack traces
- Key business logic

Low-value tokens (compress/prune):
- Legal disclaimers
- Verbose system messages
- Redundant explanations
- Boilerplate headers
```

### Dynamic Budget Strategies

Smart systems adapt prompts based on:

1. **User tier**: Enterprise clients get full-context prompts; free-tier users get compressed variants
2. **Query complexity**: Short factual queries trigger slimmed prompts; exploratory tasks trigger richer ones
3. **Task success rate**: Increase budget for failing tasks, decrease for consistently successful patterns

## 2. Context Prioritization Frameworks

### The "Lost in the Middle" Problem

Research from Stanford (2023-2024) and MIT (2025) established:

- LLMs exhibit **U-shaped attention**: highest attention at beginning (primacy) and end (recency)
- **15-47% performance drop** as context length increases
- Information in the middle of context windows is accessed less reliably

### Mitigation Strategies

**Position-Aware Ordering**:
```text
1. Place most critical information at START of context
2. Place second-most critical information at END
3. Put supporting/optional context in MIDDLE
4. Echo key facts at multiple positions for redundancy
```

**Practical Implementation**:
```text
[CRITICAL: Main objective and constraints]
[Supporting context and background]
[Historical data and examples]
[ECHO: Restate key requirements]
```

### Context Priority Tiers

**Tier 1 - Always Include**:
- Current user query/request
- Active task objective
- Critical constraints and requirements
- Recent relevant decisions

**Tier 2 - Include When Space Permits**:
- Conversation summary
- Relevant code snippets
- Related documentation excerpts

**Tier 3 - Compress or Exclude**:
- Full conversation history
- Complete file contents
- Verbose explanations
- Redundant examples

### Selective Context Injection

Rather than including all available context, dynamically select based on:

1. **Query analysis**: What does this specific question need?
2. **Relevance scoring**: Rate each context chunk 0-1
3. **Recency weighting**: Recent information often more relevant
4. **Dependency tracking**: Include prerequisites for understanding

---

## 3. Summarization Techniques

### Hierarchical Summarization

**Progressive Compression Model**:
```text
Turn 1-5:   Full verbatim (most recent)
Turn 6-15:  Detailed summary (recent context)
Turn 16-50: Condensed summary (historical)
Turn 50+:   Key decisions only (archive)
```

### Recursive Summarization

Research shows recursive summarization preserves long-term coherence:

```text
1. Summarize small dialogue chunks (5-10 turns)
2. Combine chunk summaries into section summaries
3. Generate meta-summary from section summaries
4. Retain only meta-summary + recent verbatim turns
```

### Summarization Compression Ratios

| Method | Compression | Accuracy Retention |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Key facts extraction | 10-20x | 85-95% |
| Abstractive summary | 5-10x | 90-95% |
| Extractive compression | 2-5x | 95-98% |
| Selective pruning | 1.5-3x | 98-99% |

### Memory Types for Agents

**Complete Interaction**: Retains all exchanges for complex planning tasks
**Recent Interaction**: Keeps immediate context for fast-paced Q&A
**Retrieved Interaction**: Selectively recalls history via storage systems
**External Interaction**: Integrates API calls for dynamic data retrieval

### Auto-Compaction Triggers

Best practice: Trigger compaction at **95% context usage** (as used by Claude Code)

Compaction should preserve:
- Primary objectives
- Key decisions made
- Critical constraints
- Recent context verbatim

---

## 4. RAG Best Practices

### Chunking Strategy Selection

**NVIDIA 2024 Benchmark Results**:

| Strategy | Accuracy | Std Dev | Best For |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| Page-level | 0.648 | 0.107 | Documents with clear structure |
| RecursiveCharacter (400 tokens) | 0.881-0.895 | 0.12 | General purpose |
| Semantic chunking | 0.913-0.919 | 0.15 | Complex narratives |

**Recommended Starting Point**:
```text
Method: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
Size: 400-512 tokens
Overlap: 10-20% (40-100 tokens)
```

### Query-Type Optimization

| Query Type | Optimal Chunk Size |
|------------|-------------------|
| Factoid (who/what/when) | 256-512 tokens |
| Analytical (why/how) | 1024+ tokens |
| Multi-hop reasoning | 512-1024 tokens |
| Code retrieval | 256-512 tokens |

### Chunk Overlap Guidelines

**Why overlap matters**:
- Prevents sentence/idea splitting at boundaries
- Maintains context continuity
- Reduces "lost in the middle" effects

**Recommended overlaps**:
```text
Small chunks (256 tokens): 50-75 token overlap (20-30%)
Medium chunks (512 tokens): 50-100 token overlap (10-20%)
Large chunks (1024 tokens): 100-150 token overlap (10-15%)
```

### Embedding Model Selection (2025)

**Top performers**:

| Model | Strengths | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| E5-Large-V2 | High accuracy, open-source | General RAG |
| E5-Mistral | Best overall retrieval | Enterprise |
| BGE-M3 | Multilingual, flexible | International |
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | Easy integration | API-first |
| Cohere Embed v3 | Production-ready | Enterprise |

### Pre-Retrieval Compression

**RECOMP approach**: Compress retrieved documents into concise summaries before integration

Benefits:
- Reduces computational costs
- Alleviates LLM burden
- Improves response quality by filtering noise

**Compression flow**:
```text
Query → Retrieve (10 docs) → Compress (to 3-5 summaries) → Generate
```

### Token Savings with RAG

RAG can **cut context-related token usage by 70%+** by providing only relevant context instead of entire documents.

## 5. Prompt Caching Implementation

### Anthropic Claude Prompt Caching

**Requirements**:
- Minimum 1,024 tokens for Opus/Sonnet models
- Minimum 2,048 tokens for Haiku models
- Up to 4 cache breakpoints per prompt

**Cost Structure**:
```text
5-minute cache write:  1.25x base input price
1-hour cache write:    2.0x base input price
Cache read:            0.1x base input price (90% savings)
```

**Typical savings**: 15-30% cost reduction, up to 90% for repetitive contexts

### Cache Optimization Strategies

**Prompt Structure for Caching**:
```text
[CACHED: System prompt + tools + stable context]
    ↓ cache_control breakpoint
[CACHED: Examples and few-shot demonstrations]
    ↓ cache_control breakpoint
[DYNAMIC: User query and recent context]
```

**Cache Hierarchy** (changes invalidate downstream):
```text
tools → system → messages
```

### Extended Thinking + Caching

For tasks >5 minutes, use 1-hour cache duration to maintain hits across:
- Long thinking sessions
- Multi-step workflows
- Tool use with preserved thinking blocks

### Semantic Caching

**GPT Semantic Cache results** (2024):
- **68.8% reduction** in API calls
- **97%+ accuracy** on cache hits
- Cache hit rates: 61.6-68.8% across query categories

**Implementation**:
```python
# Pseudocode for semantic caching
query_embedding = embed(user_query)
similar_queries = vector_search(query_embedding, threshold=0.92)
if similar_queries:
    return cached_response(similar_queries[0])
else:
    response = llm_call(user_query)
    cache_store(query_embedding, response)
    return response
```

**Similarity threshold guidelines**:
- 0.95+: Very conservative (fewer hits, higher accuracy)
- 0.90-0.95: Balanced (recommended)
- 0.85-0.90: Aggressive (more hits, verify accuracy)

---

## 6. Cost-Quality Tradeoff Guidelines

### Model Routing (RouteLLM)

Route simpler queries to cheaper models:

```text
Query → Router → [Simple?] → Small Model (GPT-4-mini, Haiku)
                 [Complex?] → Large Model (GPT-4, Opus)
```

**Results**: Same performance as premium routing at **40%+ lower cost**

### Cascading Strategy

Process queries through increasingly capable models:
```text
Query → Haiku → [Confident?] → Return
               [Uncertain?] → Sonnet → [Confident?] → Return
                                       [Uncertain?] → Opus → Return
```

### Cost Optimization Levers (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Output token control** (highest impact)
   - Output tokens cost 3-5x input tokens
   - Set explicit max_tokens limits
   - Request concise responses

2. **Prompt compression**
   - Use LLMLingua for up to 20x compression
   - 70-94% cost savings possible

3. **Caching** (15-30% typical savings)
   - Prompt caching for repeated context
   - Semantic caching for similar queries

4. **Model selection**
   - Use smallest model that meets quality bar
   - Route by query complexity

5. **RAG optimization**
   - Retrieve less, compress more
   - Filter noise before context

### When to Use Which Model Tier

| Tier | Models | Use Cases | Cost |
|------|--------|-----------|------|
| Frontier | Opus, GPT-4, o1 | Complex reasoning, novel problems | $$$ |
| Capable | Sonnet, GPT-4-mini | Most production tasks | $$ |
| Fast | Haiku, GPT-3.5 | Classification, simple Q&A | $ |

### Break-Even Analysis

For organizations spending >$500/month on cloud APIs:
- Local LLM deployment breaks even in **6-12 months**
- Consider for consistent, high-volume workloads

- Measures: Did we retrieve all relevant information?
- Target: >90% for production systems

**Precision Ω**:
- Maximum achievable precision under perfect recall
- Captures retrieval quality ceiling

**IoU (Intersection over Union)**:
- Balances completeness and efficiency
- Better for token-level evaluation than document-level

### Compression Quality Metrics

|--------|-------------|--------|
| Compression ratio | Original/Compressed tokens | 5-20x |
| Information retention | % of key facts preserved | >90% |
| Task accuracy delta | Original - Compressed accuracy | <5% |

### Cost Efficiency Metrics

```text
Cost per successful query = Total API cost / Successful responses
Token efficiency = Useful output tokens / Total tokens consumed
Cache hit rate = Cached responses / Total requests
Routing accuracy = Correct tier selections / Total routed queries
```

### Performance Benchmarks (2024-2025)
