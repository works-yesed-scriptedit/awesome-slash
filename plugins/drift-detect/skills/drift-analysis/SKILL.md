# Reality Analysis

Knowledge and patterns for analyzing project state, detecting plan drift, and creating prioritized reconstruction plans.

## Architecture Overview

```
/drift-detect
        │
        ├─→ collectors.js (pure JavaScript)
        │   ├─ scanGitHubState()
        │   ├─ analyzeDocumentation()
        │   └─ scanCodebase()
        │
        └─→ plan-synthesizer (Opus)
            └─ Deep semantic analysis with full context
```

**Data collection**: Pure JavaScript (no LLM overhead)
**Semantic analysis**: Single Opus call with complete context

## Drift Detection Patterns

### Types of Drift

**Plan Drift**: When documented plans diverge from actual implementation
- PLAN.md items remain unchecked for extended periods
- Roadmap milestones slip without updates
- Sprint/phase goals not reflected in code changes

**Documentation Drift**: When documentation falls behind implementation
- New features exist without corresponding docs
- README describes features that don't exist
- API docs don't match actual endpoints

**Issue Drift**: When issue tracking diverges from reality
- Stale issues that no longer apply
- Completed work without closed issues
- High-priority items neglected

**Scope Drift**: When project scope expands beyond original plans
- More features documented than can be delivered
- Continuous addition without completion
- Ever-growing backlog with no pruning

### Detection Signals

```
HIGH-CONFIDENCE DRIFT INDICATORS:
- Milestone 30+ days overdue with open issues
- PLAN.md < 30% completion after 90 days
- 5+ high-priority issues stale > 60 days
- README features not found in codebase

MEDIUM-CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- Documentation files unchanged for 180+ days
- Draft PRs open > 30 days
- Issue themes don't match code activity
- Large gap between documented and implemented features

LOW-CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- Many TODOs in codebase
- Stale dependencies
- Old git branches not merged
```

## Prioritization Framework

### Priority Calculation

```javascript
function calculatePriority(item, weights) {
  let score = 0;

  // Severity base score
  const severityScores = {
    critical: 15,
    high: 10,
    medium: 5,
    low: 2
  };
  score += severityScores[item.severity] || 5;

  // Category multiplier
  const categoryWeights = {
    security: 2.0,    // Security issues get 2x
    bugs: 1.5,        // Bugs get 1.5x
    infrastructure: 1.3,
    features: 1.0,
    documentation: 0.8
  };
  score *= categoryWeights[item.category] || 1.0;

  // Recency boost
  if (item.createdRecently) score *= 1.2;

  // Stale penalty (old items slightly deprioritized)
  if (item.daysStale > 180) score *= 0.9;

  return Math.round(score);
}
```

### Time Bucket Thresholds

| Bucket | Criteria | Max Items |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Immediate | severity=critical OR priority >= 15 | 5 |
| Short-term | severity=high OR priority >= 10 | 10 |
| Medium-term | priority >= 5 | 15 |
| Backlog | everything else | 20 |

### Priority Weights (Default)

```yaml
security: 10     # Security issues always top priority
bugs: 8          # Bugs affect users directly
features: 5      # New functionality
documentation: 3 # Important but not urgent
tech-debt: 4     # Keeps codebase healthy
```

## Cross-Reference Patterns

### Document-to-Code Matching

```javascript
// Fuzzy matching for feature names
function featureMatch(docFeature, codeFeature) {
  const normalize = s => s
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[-_\s]+/g, '')
    .replace(/s$/, ''); // Remove trailing 's'

  const docNorm = normalize(docFeature);
  const codeNorm = normalize(codeFeature);

  return docNorm.includes(codeNorm) ||
         codeNorm.includes(docNorm) ||
         levenshteinDistance(docNorm, codeNorm) < 3;
}
```

### Common Mismatches

| Documented As | Implemented As |
|---------------|----------------|
| "user authentication" | auth/, login/, session/ |
| "API endpoints" | routes/, api/, handlers/ |
| "database models" | models/, entities/, schemas/ |
| "caching layer" | cache/, redis/, memcache/ |
| "logging system" | logger/, logs/, telemetry/ |

## Output Templates

### Backlog
{backlog_items_numbered}
```

## Best Practices

### When Analyzing Drift

1. **Compare timestamps, not just content**
   - When was the doc last updated vs. last code change?
   - Are milestones dated realistically?

2. **Look for patterns, not individual items**
   - One stale issue isn't drift; 10 stale issues is a pattern
   - One undocumented feature isn't drift; 5 undocumented features is

3. **Consider context**
   - Active development naturally has some drift
   - Mature projects should have minimal drift
   - Post-launch projects often have documentation lag

4. **Weight by impact**
   - User-facing drift matters more than internal
   - Public API drift matters more than implementation details

### When Creating Plans

1. **Be actionable, not exhaustive**
   - Top 5 immediate items, not top 50
   - Each item should be completable in reasonable time

2. **Group related items**
   - "Update authentication docs" not "Update login page docs" + "Update signup docs"

3. **Include success criteria**
   - How do we know this drift item is resolved?

4. **Balance categories**
   - All security first, but don't ignore everything else
   - Mix quick wins with important work

## Data Collection (JavaScript)

The collectors.js module extracts data without LLM overhead:

### GitHub Data
- Open issues categorized by labels
- Open PRs with draft status
- Milestones with due dates
- Stale items (> 90 days inactive)
- Theme analysis from titles

### Documentation Data
- Parsed README, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Checkbox completion counts
- Section analysis
- Feature lists

### Code Data
- Directory structure
- Framework detection
- Test framework presence
- Health indicators (CI, linting, tests)

## Semantic Analysis (Opus)

The plan-synthesizer receives all collected data and performs:

1. **Cross-referencing**: Match documented features to implementation
2. **Drift identification**: Find divergence patterns
3. **Gap analysis**: Identify what's missing
4. **Prioritization**: Context-aware ranking
5. **Report generation**: Actionable recommendations

## Example Input/Output

### Collected Data (from collectors.js)

```json
{
  "github": {
    "issues": [...],
    "categorized": { "bugs": [...], "features": [...] },
    "stale": [...]
  },
  "docs": {
    "files": { "README.md": {...}, "PLAN.md": {...} },
    "checkboxes": { "total": 15, "checked": 3 }
  },
  "code": {
    "frameworks": ["Express"],
    "health": { "hasTests": true, "hasCi": true }
  }
}
```

### Analysis Output (from plan-synthesizer)

```markdown
# Reality Check Report

## Executive Summary
Project has moderate drift: 8 stale priority issues and 20% plan completion.
Strong code health (tests + CI) but documentation lags implementation.

## Drift Analysis
### Priority Neglect
**Severity**: high
8 high-priority issues inactive for 60+ days...

## Prioritized Plan
### Immediate
1. Close #45 (already implemented)
2. Update README API section...
```
