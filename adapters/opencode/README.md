## OpenCode-Specific Features

OpenCode provides additional features you can combine with awesome-slash commands:

### File Includes with `@`

Include file contents in your prompt:

```bash
opencode
> /project-review @src/main.py @tests/test_main.py
```

This adds the file contents to the context before running the review.

### Bash Output with `!`

Include bash command output:

```bash
opencode
> /deslop-around apply !git diff --name-only
```

This runs `git diff --name-only` and includes the output in the prompt.

### Combined Usage

```bash
opencode
> /next-task @PLAN.md !gh issue list
```

Analyzes tasks with PLAN.md content and current GitHub issues.
