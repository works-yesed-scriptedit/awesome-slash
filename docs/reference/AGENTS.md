## next-task Plugin Agents

### task-discoverer

**Model:** sonnet
**Purpose:** Find and prioritize tasks from configured sources.

**What it does:**
1. Loads claimed tasks from `tasks.json` (excludes them)
2. Fetches from GitHub/GitLab/local files/custom CLI
3. Applies priority scoring (labels, blockers, age, reactions)
4. Validates tasks against codebase
5. Presents top 5 via AskUserQuestion checkboxes
6. Posts "Workflow Started" comment to GitHub issue

**Tools available:**
- Bash (gh, glab, git)
- Grep, Read
- AskUserQuestion

---

### worktree-manager

**Model:** haiku
**Purpose:** Create git worktrees for isolated development.

**What it does:**
1. Creates `../worktrees/{task-slug}/` directory
2. Creates `feature/{task-slug}` branch
3. Claims task in `tasks.json`
4. Creates `flow.json` in worktree

**Tools available:**
- Bash (git only)
- Read, Write

---

### exploration-agent

**Model:** opus
**Purpose:** Deep codebase analysis before planning.

**What it does:**
1. Extracts keywords from task description
2. Searches for related files
3. Traces dependency graphs
4. Analyzes existing patterns
5. Outputs exploration report

**Tools available:**
- Read, Glob, Grep
- Bash (git only)
- LSP
- Task (for sub-exploration)

**Why opus:** Exploration quality directly impacts planning quality. Poor exploration = poor plan = poor implementation. The compound effect justifies the cost.

---

### planning-agent

**Model:** opus
**Purpose:** Design step-by-step implementation plans.

**What it does:**
1. Synthesizes exploration findings
2. Creates implementation steps
3. Identifies risks and critical paths
4. Outputs structured JSON
5. Posts summary to GitHub issue

**Tools available:**
- Read, Glob, Grep
- Bash (git only)
- Task (for research)

**Output format:**

```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "action": "modify", "file": "src/auth.ts", "description": "..." }
  ],
  "risks": ["..."],
  "complexity": "medium"
}
```

**Why opus:** Planning is the leverage point. A good plan makes implementation straightforward. A bad plan causes rework cycles.

---

### implementation-agent

**Model:** opus
**Purpose:** Execute approved plans with production-quality code.

**What it does:**
1. Executes plan step-by-step
2. Creates atomic commits per step
3. Runs type checks, linting, tests after each step
4. Updates `flow.json` for resume capability

**Tools available:**
- Read, Write, Edit
- Glob, Grep
- Bash (git, npm, node)
- Task (for sub-tasks)
- LSP

**Restrictions:**
- MUST NOT create PR
- MUST NOT push to remote
- MUST NOT invoke review agents

**Why opus:** Implementation quality matters. Bad code gets caught in review but wastes cycles. Good code flows through.

---

### deslop-work

**Model:** sonnet
**Purpose:** Clean AI artifacts from new code before review.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes git diff (only new changes)
2. Invokes `/deslop` pipeline
3. Applies HIGH certainty fixes
4. Flags LOW certainty for review

**Tools available:**

**Why sonnet:** Slop detection is pattern-based. Sonnet handles patterns well and is faster/cheaper than opus.

---

### test-coverage-checker

**Model:** sonnet
**Purpose:** Validate test quality for new code.

**What it does:**
1. Identifies new/modified functions
2. Checks if tests exist
3. Checks if tests are meaningful (not just path matching)
4. Reports coverage status

**Tools available:**
- Bash (git, npm)
- Read, Grep, Glob

**Advisory only:** Does not block workflow. Reports findings but continues.

---

### review-orchestrator

   - Test coverage
2. Adds conditional specialists (DB, architecture, API, frontend, backend, devops)
3. Aggregates findings by severity
4. Writes a review queue file in the platform state dir
5. Fixes all non-false-positive issues
6. Runs deslop-work after each iteration
7. Loops until no open issues remain
8. Stops early on iteration limit or stall and returns control for decision

**Tools available:**
- Task (for sub-agents)
- Bash (git)
- Read, Write, Edit

**Restrictions:**
- MUST NOT create PR
- MUST NOT push
- MUST NOT invoke delivery-validator

**Why opus:** Review coordination requires judgment. Which findings are real? Which can be auto-fixed? How to prioritize? Opus handles this well.

---

**Tools available:**
- Bash (git, npm)
- Read, Grep, Glob

**On failure:** Returns to implementation with fix instructions.

**Restrictions:**
- MUST NOT create PR
- MUST NOT push
- MUST NOT skip docs-updater

---

### docs-updater

**Model:** sonnet
**Purpose:** Update documentation for recent changes.

**What it does:**
1. Finds docs referencing changed files
2. Updates CHANGELOG entry
3. Fixes outdated imports/versions
4. Delegates simple edits to simple-fixer
5. Invokes `/ship` when complete

**Tools available:**
- Bash (git)

**What it does:**
- Receives structured fix list from parent
- Executes each fix: remove-line, replace, insert
- No decision-making, just execution

**Tools available:**
- Read, Edit
- Bash (git)

**Why haiku:** Pure execution. No reasoning needed. Haiku is fast and cheap.

---

### ci-monitor

**Model:** haiku
**Purpose:** Poll CI status with sleep/check loops.

**What it does:**
1. Polls `gh pr checks` every 15 seconds
2. Reports status changes
3. On failure: delegates to ci-fixer
4. On success: continues workflow

**Tools available:**
- Bash (gh, git)
- Read
- Task (for ci-fixer)

**Why haiku:** Polling is mechanical. No judgment needed.

---

## Model Selection Rationale

| Agent Type | Model | Reasoning |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Analysis/reasoning | opus | Quality compounds - errors propagate |
| Pattern matching | sonnet | Good at structured tasks, fast |
| Mechanical execution | haiku | No judgment needed, cheapest |

**Key insight:** For enhancers and analyzers, quality loss is exponential. Each imperfection in analysis creates downstream problems.

---

## Tool Restrictions

Agents have restricted tool access for safety:

| Agent | Restricted From | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| implementation-agent | PR creation, git push | Workflow enforces order |
| review-orchestrator | PR creation, git push | Must complete review first |
| delivery-validator | PR creation, git push | Must pass validation first |
| worktree-manager | Most tools | Only needs git |
| simple-fixer | Most tools | Only needs edit |
