# Documentation

AI models can write code. The bottleneck is everything else—picking tasks, managing branches, reviewing output, handling CI, addressing comments, deploying. These docs show how awesome-slash automates the full workflow, not just the coding part.

## Key Concepts

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/next-task` | Task discovery → implementation → review → ship |
| `/ship` | Push → PR → CI → reviews → merge → deploy |
| `/deslop` | 3-phase slop detection and cleanup |
| `/audit-project` | Multi-agent code review |
| `/drift-detect` | Compare docs to actual code |
| `/enhance` | Analyze prompts, plugins, docs |
| `/sync-docs` | Sync docs with code changes |

### State Files

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `tasks.json` | `{state-dir}/` | Which task is active |
| `flow.json` | `{state-dir}/` (worktree) | Which phase you're in |
| `preference.json` | `{state-dir}/sources/` | Cached task source preference |

State directories by platform:
- Claude Code: `.claude/`
- OpenCode: `.opencode/`
- Codex CLI: `.codex/`

### Agent Models

| Model | Used For |
|-------|----------|
| opus | Complex reasoning (exploration, planning, implementation, review) |
| sonnet | Pattern matching (slop detection, validation, discovery) |
| haiku | Mechanical execution (worktree, simple-fixer, ci-monitor) |

### Certainty Levels

| Level | Meaning | Auto-Fix? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | Security issue | Yes (with warning) |
| HIGH | Definite problem | Yes |
| MEDIUM | Probable problem | No |
| LOW | Possible problem | No |
