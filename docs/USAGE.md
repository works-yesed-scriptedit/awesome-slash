# Usage Guide

Complete guide to using awesome-slash commands with real-world examples.

---

## Command Overview

| Command | Purpose | Scope |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `/deslop-around` | Clean up debugging code, TODOs | Fast codebase scan |
| `/next-task` | Find and implement prioritized tasks | Full autonomous workflow |
| `/project-review` | Multi-agent code review | Thorough analysis |
| `/ship` | Complete PR workflow to production | CI, deployment, validation |

---

## When to Use Each Command

**Starting Your Day:**
```bash
/next-task
# Shows prioritized tasks from GitHub issues
```

**Before Committing:**
```bash
/deslop-around apply
# Cleans up debugging code
```

**Before Creating PR:**
```bash
/project-review
# Catches issues early
```

**Ready to Deploy:**
```bash
/ship
# Handles everything: PR, CI, merge, deploy, validate
```

---

## Command Reference

### `/deslop-around`

Remove debugging code, old TODOs, and AI slop from your codebase with a 3-phase detection pipeline.

```bash
/deslop-around                    # Report mode (safe, no changes)
/deslop-around apply              # Apply fixes automatically
/deslop-around apply src/ 10      # Fix 10 issues in src/ only
```

**Architecture:**
- **Phase 1** - Built-in regex patterns (HIGH certainty) - always runs
- **Phase 2** - Multi-pass analyzers (MEDIUM certainty) - context-aware
- **Phase 3** - Optional CLI tools (LOW certainty) - graceful degradation
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: jscpd, madge, escomplex
  - Python: pylint, radon
  - Go: golangci-lint
  - Rust: clippy

**Thoroughness levels:**
- `quick` - Phase 1 only (fastest)
- `normal` - Phase 1 + Phase 2 (default, recommended)
- `deep` - All phases if tools available (most thorough)

**Detects:**
- Console debugging (`console.log`, `print()`, `dbg!()`)
- Old TODOs and commented code
- Placeholder text, magic numbers
- Empty catch blocks, disabled linters
- Placeholder functions
- Excessive documentation
- Phantom references
- Buzzword inflation
- Code smells and over-engineering patterns

### `/next-task`

Complete task-to-production automation with state management.

```bash
/next-task                        # Start new workflow with policy selection
/next-task --status               # Check current workflow state
/next-task --resume               # Resume from last checkpoint
/next-task --abort                # Cancel workflow and cleanup
/next-task bug                    # Filter by task type
/next-task --implement            # Start implementing selected task
```

**18-Phase Workflow:**
1. Policy Selection → Configure workflow policy
2. Task Discovery → Find and prioritize tasks
3. Worktree Setup → Create isolated environment
4. Exploration → Deep codebase analysis
5. Planning → Design implementation plan
6. **User Approval → Get plan approval (LAST human interaction)**
7. Implementation → Execute the plan
8. Review Loop → Multi-agent review until approved
9. Delivery Approval → Autonomous completion validation
10. Ship Prep → Prepare for shipping
11. Create PR → Create pull request
12. CI Wait → Wait for continuous integration
13. Comment Fix → Address PR feedback
14. Merge → Merge pull request
15. Production CI → Production pipeline validation
16. Deploy → Deploy to production
17. Production Release → Production release validation
18. Complete → Finalize and cleanup

---

### `/project-review`

Comprehensive multi-agent code review.

```bash
/project-review                   # Full review with all agents
/project-review --quick           # Single-pass review
/project-review --domain security # Security review only
/project-review --recent          # Only recent changes
```

**8 Specialized Agents:**
- Security
- Performance
- Architecture
- Testing
- Error Handling
- Code Quality
- Type Safety
- Documentation

---

### `/ship`

Complete PR workflow from commit to production.

```bash
/ship                             # Full workflow
/ship --dry-run                   # Preview without executing
/ship --strategy rebase           # Use rebase instead of squash
/ship --state-file PATH           # Integrate with next-task workflow
```

**Stages:**
1. Pre-flight checks and platform detection
2. Commit with AI-generated message
3. Create PR with context
4. Wait for CI and address PR feedback
5. Multi-agent review (standalone mode only)
6. Merge PR
7. Deploy to development (if configured)
8. Validate development deployment
9. Deploy to production (if configured)
10. Validate production deployment
11. Cleanup
12. Completion report

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Clean Up Debugging Code

**Scenario**: Console.log statements and TODOs scattered in your code.

```text
You: /deslop-around

Claude:
Detected: Node.js project, single-branch workflow

Found 8 issues:
1. src/app.js:15 - console.log("User logged in")
2. src/app.js:42 - // TODO: Add validation
3. src/utils.js:8 - console.log("Debug:", data)
4. src/api.js:23 - // FIXME: This is hacky
5. src/api.js:67 - empty catch block
...

Would you like me to apply fixes?

You: Apply fixes, but keep the console.log in tests

Claude:
✓ Removed 5 console.log statements
✓ Removed 2 old TODO comments
✓ Added logging to empty catch block
✓ Kept test console.logs

Running tests... ✓ All tests pass
Ready to commit!
```

### Example 3: Get Code Review Before PR

**Scenario**: Finished login feature, want thorough review.

```text
You: /project-review

Claude:
Detected: React + TypeScript project
Launching specialized review agents...

Review Complete! Found 4 issues:

CRITICAL (1):
1. Security: src/api/auth.ts:45
   Issue: Password sent in URL parameters
   Fix: Use POST body instead

HIGH (2):
2. React: src/components/LoginForm.tsx:23

5. /ship                     # Deploy
```

### Code Review Flow

```text
1. /project-review --quick   # Quick check
2. Fix issues
3. /project-review           # Full review

## Tips for Success

### Tip 1: Start Small

Don't start with `/ship` on production immediately!

**Try this order:**
1. `/deslop-around report` - Just look, no changes
2. `/next-task` - See task prioritization
3. `/deslop-around apply` - Make safe changes
4. `/project-review --quick` - Quick feedback
5. `/ship --dry-run` - Preview the workflow
6. `/ship` - Full deployment

### Tip 2: Let Claude Explain

```text
You: Can you explain what /ship will do in my project?

Claude: *analyzes your project*
I see you have:
- GitHub Actions CI
- Railway deployment
- Single-branch workflow

Here's what /ship will do:
1. Commit your changes
2. Create PR to main
3. Wait for GitHub Actions
4. Run code review
5. Merge to main
6. Railway auto-deploys
7. Validate deployment
```

### Tip 3: Combine Commands

```text
You: Run /deslop-around, then /project-review, then /ship

Claude:
1. Cleaning up slop... ✓ Removed 5 issues
2. Running review... ✓ Fixed 2 issues
3. Shipping to production... ✓ Complete!

Your code is cleaned, reviewed, and deployed!
```

### Tip 4: Use Filters

```bash
/next-task bug              # Focus on bugs only
/project-review --domain security   # Security review only
/deslop-around apply src/ 10        # Limit scope
```
