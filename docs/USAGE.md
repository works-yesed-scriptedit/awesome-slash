# Usage Guide

You shouldn't have to repeat the same requests every session. These commands handle entire workflows—from picking a task to merging a PR—with just a few interactions. You approve the plan, then the system runs autonomously.

**For deep dives:** See [workflow documentation](./workflows/) for phase-by-phase breakdowns.

---

## When to Use Each Command

**Starting Your Day:**
```bash
/next-task
# Shows prioritized tasks from GitHub issues
```

**Before Committing:**
```bash
/deslop apply
# Cleans up debugging code
```

**Before Creating PR:**
```bash
/audit-project
# Catches issues early
```

**Ready to Deploy:**
```bash
/ship
# Handles everything: PR, CI, merge, deploy, validate
```

---

## Command Reference

### `/deslop`

Remove debugging code, old TODOs, and AI slop from your codebase with a 3-phase detection pipeline.

```bash
/deslop                    # Report mode (safe, no changes)
/deslop apply              # Apply fixes automatically
/deslop apply src/ 10      # Fix 10 issues in src/ only
```

**Architecture:**
- **Phase 1** - Built-in regex patterns (HIGH certainty) - always runs
- **Phase 2** - Multi-pass analyzers (MEDIUM certainty) - context-aware
- **Phase 3** - Optional CLI tools (LOW certainty) - graceful degradation
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: jscpd, madge, escomplex
  - Python: pylint, radon
  - Go: golangci-lint
  - Rust: clippy

**Thoroughness levels:**
- `quick` - Phase 1 only (fastest)
- `normal` - Phase 1 + Phase 2 (default, recommended)
- `deep` - All phases if tools available (most thorough)

**Detects:**
- Console debugging (`console.log`, `print()`, `dbg!()`)
- Old TODOs and commented code
- Placeholder text, magic numbers
- Empty catch blocks, disabled linters
- Placeholder functions
- Excessive documentation
- Phantom references
- Buzzword inflation
- Code smells and over-engineering patterns

---

### `/next-task`

Complete task-to-production automation with state management.

```bash
/next-task                        # Start new workflow with policy selection
/next-task --status               # Check current workflow state
/next-task --resume               # Resume from last checkpoint
/next-task --abort                # Cancel workflow and cleanup
/next-task bug                    # Filter by task type
/next-task --implement            # Start implementing selected task
```

**12-Phase Workflow:**
1. Policy Selection → Choose task source, priority, stopping point
2. Task Discovery → Find and prioritize tasks, you pick one
3. Worktree Setup → Create isolated branch and directory
4. Exploration → Deep codebase analysis
5. Planning → Design implementation plan
6. **User Approval → Approve the plan (LAST human interaction)**
7. Implementation → Execute the plan
8. Pre-Review → Clean AI slop, check test coverage
9. Review Loop → Multi-agent review until clean
10. Delivery Validation → Verify tests, build, requirements
11. Docs Update → Sync documentation
12. Ship → Create PR, monitor CI, address comments, merge

[Full workflow documentation →](./workflows/NEXT-TASK.md)

---

### `/audit-project`

Comprehensive multi-agent code review that adapts to your project.

```bash
/audit-project                   # Full review with all agents
/audit-project --quick           # Single-pass review
/audit-project --domain security # Security review only
/audit-project --recent          # Only recent changes
```

**8 Specialized Roles (2 always active, 6 conditional):**

| Agent | When Active | Focus Area |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| security-expert | Always | Vulnerabilities, auth, secrets |
| performance-engineer | Always | N+1 queries, memory, blocking ops |
| test-quality-guardian | If tests exist | Coverage, edge cases, mocking |
| architecture-reviewer | If 50+ files | Modularity, patterns, SOLID |
| database-specialist | If DB detected | Queries, indexes, transactions |
| api-designer | If API detected | REST, errors, pagination |
| frontend-specialist | If frontend detected | Components, state, UX |
| devops-reviewer | If CI/CD detected | Pipelines, configs, secrets |

Only relevant agents run based on your codebase - no wasted analysis.

---

### `/sync-docs`

Sync documentation with actual code state. Find outdated references, update CHANGELOG, flag stale examples.

```bash
/sync-docs                    # Report mode (safe, no changes)
/sync-docs apply              # Apply auto-fixable issues
/sync-docs report src/        # Check docs related to src/
/sync-docs --all              # Full codebase scan
```

**Phases:**
1. Get changed files (since last commit to main, or all with `--all`)
2. Find related documentation (references to changed files)
3. Analyze issues (outdated imports, removed exports, version mismatches)
4. Check CHANGELOG (undocumented commits)
5. Report findings or apply fixes

**Auto-fixable (apply mode):**
- Outdated version numbers
- CHANGELOG entries for undocumented commits

**Flagged for manual review:**
- Removed exports referenced in docs
- Code examples that may need context updates

---

### `/ship`

Complete PR workflow from commit to production.

```bash
/ship                             # Full workflow
/ship --dry-run                   # Preview without executing
/ship --strategy rebase           # Use rebase instead of squash
/ship --state-file PATH           # Integrate with next-task workflow
```

**Stages:**
1. Pre-flight checks and platform detection
2. Commit with AI-generated message
3. Create PR with context
4. Wait for CI and address PR feedback
5. Multi-agent review (standalone mode only)
6. Merge PR
7. Deploy to development (if configured)
8. Validate development deployment
9. Deploy to production (if configured)
10. Validate production deployment
11. Cleanup
12. Completion report

Found 8 issues:
1. src/app.js:15 - console.log("User logged in")
2. src/app.js:42 - // TODO: Add validation
3. src/utils.js:8 - console.log("Debug:", data)
4. src/api.js:23 - // FIXME: This is hacky

## Tips for Success

### Tip 1: Start Small

Don't start with `/ship` on production immediately!

**Try this order:**
1. `/deslop report` - Just look, no changes
2. `/next-task` - See task prioritization
3. `/deslop apply` - Make safe changes
4. `/audit-project --quick` - Quick feedback
5. `/ship --dry-run` - Preview the workflow
6. `/ship` - Full deployment

### Tip 2: Let Claude Explain

```text
You: Can you explain what /ship will do in my project?

Claude: *analyzes your project*
I see you have:
- GitHub Actions CI
- Railway deployment
- Single-branch workflow

Here's what /ship will do:
1. Commit your changes
2. Create PR to main
3. Wait for GitHub Actions
4. Run code review
5. Merge to main
6. Railway auto-deploys
7. Validate deployment
```

### Tip 3: Combine Commands

```text
You: Run /deslop, then /audit-project, then /ship

Claude:
1. Cleaning up slop... ✓ Removed 5 issues
2. Running review... ✓ Fixed 2 issues
3. Shipping to production... ✓ Complete!

Your code is cleaned, reviewed, and deployed!
```

### Tip 4: Use Filters

```bash
/next-task bug              # Focus on bugs only
/audit-project --domain security   # Security review only
/deslop apply src/ 10        # Limit scope
```
